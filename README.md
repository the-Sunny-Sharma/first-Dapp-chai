# Welcome to the Chai Shop! ☕️

Ever felt the urge to send a virtual chai (or coffee, pizza, anything really!) to a brilliant developer who brightened your day? Well, now you can! This little decentralized application runs on the Sepolia testnet, letting you anonymously fuel the minds behind the projects you love without risking your real ETH.

## Built with Love (and Chai)

This project is lovingly crafted with:

**Harhat**: A powerful framework for building and testing decentralized applications. Huge thanks to the Harhat team for making this possible!
**React JS**: For a smooth and user-friendly frontend experience.
**Codeater's Inspiration**: A big shoutout to Kshitij Sir for the amazing tutorial that kickstarted this project.

## How to Buy a Chai

1. **Install MetaMask**: Download and install the MetaMask browser extension from [https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/).

2. **Create a Sepolia Testnet Account**: Follow the on-screen prompts to create a new account.

3. **Get Sepolia Testnet ETH**: Visit a faucet like [https://swap.perseverance.chainflip.io/](https://swap.perseverance.chainflip.io/) to obtain some test ETH.

4. **Connect MetaMask**: In your browser, navigate to the Chai Shop application and click the "Connect Wallet" button.

5. **Send a Chai**: Select the item you want to send, enter a message, and click "Pay." MetaMask will prompt you to confirm the transaction.

   **Important Note**: Remember, this is the Sepolia testnet, so any ETH you send is not real. Use it freely to explore the application and support developers.
